Phishing stands for a fraudulent process, where an attacker tries to obtain sensitive information from the victim. Usually, these kinds of attacks are done via emails, text messages, or websites. Phishing websites, which are nowadays in a considerable rise, have the same look as legitimate sites. However, their backend is designed to collect sensitive information that is inputted by the victim. Discovering and detecting phishing websites has recently also gained the machine learning communityâ€™s attention, which has built the models and performed classifications of phishing websites. This paper presents dataset variations that consist of 58,645 websites labelled as legitimate or phishing and allows the others to train their classification models, 
build phishing detection systems.


## Problem Statement
Phishing is a type of fraud in which an attacker impersonates a reputable company or 
person in order to get sensitive information such as login credentials or account 
information via email or other communication channels. Phishing is popular among 
attackers because it is easier to persuade someone to click a malicious link that appears 
to be authentic than it is to break through a computer's protection measures


## Objective
The main objective of the project to predict wheather the domains are real or malicious.
